It is based on Gemma 3 model.\n\nIt has multiple utilizations, including:\n- Medical image classification - can be used to classiffy images of various modalities: radiology, digital pathology, fundus and skin images.\n- Medical image interpretation - can interpret a variety of medical images (various radiologic modalities as well as protocols) and answer natural language questions about medical images.\n- Medical text comprehension and clinical reasoning - for most use cases, the larger 27B model will yields the best performance but also the 4B model can achieve good results.\n\nThis Notebook will demonstrate use of the MedGemma model to convert medical transcripts to SOAP format.\n\n## What is SOAP note format?\n\nSOAP is an achronim that stands for:\n* **Subjective** - what the patient says.\n* **Objective** - what the clinician observes or measures.\n* **Assessment** - the diagnosis or differential diagnosis.\n* **Procedure** - next steps: treatment, tests, follow-ups, patient education.\n\nThe **SOAP** note provides a structured and consistent way for healthcare providers to document and communicate patient encounters, ensuring that both subjective symptoms and objective evidence are clearly organized.\n\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Prerequisites\n\nGemma 3 is supported from transformers 4.50.0.
